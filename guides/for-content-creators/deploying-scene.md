# Deploying Scene

**Effortless Scene Deployment with Void Craft: A Guided Approach**

A `scene` is a 3D experience or environment that can be either created within the Void Craft platform or imported/uploaded from external sources like Unreal Engine.

All created scenes are located in the `Experiences` tab on the dashboard.
