These pre-designed structures are categorized into three types, each serving a specific purpose:

* **Ground Structures**: These modular buildings are specifically designed for the ground floor of your parcel. They add a foundation to your virtual creation, ensuring your space has a sturdy base.
* **Upper Structures**: Upper structures are tailored for the upper floors of your building. You can add upper floors to the building if you have already selected a model for the ground floors.
* **Static Buildings**: If you're looking for a comprehensive building without the need to assemble individual floors, static buildings are the perfect solution. These complete sets come pre-built, providing a hassle-free way to enhance your parcel.
