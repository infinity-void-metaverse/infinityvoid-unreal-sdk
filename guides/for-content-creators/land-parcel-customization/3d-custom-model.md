# 3D Custom Model

When adding your own custom 3D models to your land parcel, it's essential to adhere to a few fundamental guidelines:

### **File Type and Size Limitations**:

* Accepted File Type: `.GLB`
* Size Limit: `10MB per 300sqm of your parcel`
* Max Height: `48 meters for 300 sqm parcel`

{% hint style="info" %}
We encourage you to use Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) textures and workflow when creating your models. However, Vray materials are not compatible with GLB formats.
{% endhint %}

### **Export From Blender**

To guarantee compatibility and optimal performance, we recommend exporting your custom model as a GLB file using Blender.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Before exporting ensure that the pivot of your scene is at the origin (0,0,0) and the X axis of your model should point outward from the door (entry point) in Blender. This alignment ensures that your entry point of the 3D model faces the front of the plot.
{% endhint %}

### **Using Plot Reference Model**

In order to correctly design your 3D model based on the plot's dimension we offer a Plot Reference Model that you can download from the details page of your land on the dashboard. This model serves as a blueprint, clearly indicating the dimensions of your plot and entry points.

{% hint style="info" %}
Dimensions pertain to the plot layout only. Inside your realm, you have the creative freedom to build as extensively as you wish.
{% endhint %}

### **Evaluating Your Model**

As part of the review process, your custom 3D model will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Quality of the Model**: Our team of experts will assess the technical and aesthetic quality of your model. This includes factors such as textures, geometry, and overall visual appeal. We're dedicated to showcasing the best of the metaverse, and high-quality models contribute to this goal.
2. **Dimensional Adherence**: Your model should seamlessly fit within the dimensions of your land parcel. Ensuring that your creation aligns with the plot's dimensions is vital for a cohesive and immersive experience within Vaikunth.
3. **Guideline Compliance**: To maintain a harmonious environment for all inhabitants of Vaikunth, it's essential that your custom model adheres to our community guidelines. This ensures that the content remains respectful, inclusive, and engaging for everyone.

### **The Path Forward**

Upon successful completion of the review process, your custom 3D model will be integrated into your land parcel. This allows you to showcase your creativity and share your unique vision with fellow explorers and collaborators.

In the event that any adjustments are needed or if your model doesn't meet the criteria outlined above, our content moderation team will reach out to you via your registered email address. We value open communication and are here to guide you through the process, ensuring that your experience with Vaikunth remains exceptional.
