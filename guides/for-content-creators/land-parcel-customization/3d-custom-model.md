# 3D Custom Model

When adding your own custom 3D models to your land parcel, it's essential to adhere to a few fundamental guidelines:

### **File Type and Size Limitations**:

* Accepted File Type: `.GLB`
* Size Limit: `10MB per 300sqm of your parcel`
* Max Height: `48 meters for 300sqm parcel`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Use PBR materials (except V-RAY) for your model.
{% endhint %}

### **Export From Blender**

To guarantee compatibility and optimal performance, we recommend exporting your custom model as a GLB file using Blender and adhering to the guidelines mentioned below.

#### X-axis should extend from the back of the model, pointing outward towards the front,  as depicted in the image below.

### **Using Plot Reference Model**

In order to correctly design your 3D model based on the plot's dimension we offer a Plot Reference Model that you can download from the details page of your land on the dashboard. This model serves as a blueprint, clearly indicating the dimensions of your plot and entry points.

{% hint style="info" %}
Dimensions pertain to the plot only. Inside your realm, you have the creative freedom to build as extensively as you wish.
{% endhint %}
