# Deploying Custom Model on Land Parcel

When adding your own custom 3D models to your land parcel, it's essential to adhere to a few fundamental guidelines:

**File Type and Size Limitations**:

* Accepted File Type: .GLB
* Size Limit: 10MB per 300sqm of your parcel
* Max Height: 48 meters for 300 sqm parcel

**PBR Textured Models and Workflow**: We encourage you to use Physically-Based Rendering (PBR) textures and workflow when creating your models. PBR enhances the realism of your creations by simulating how materials interact with light. This results in stunningly lifelike visuals. Ensure that your models are properly textured using PBR materials.

**Export Using Blender**: To guarantee compatibility and optimal performance, we recommend exporting your custom models as .GLB files using Blender. Blender provides a range of tools and features that align seamlessly with Infinity Void's platform, ensuring a smooth and cohesive experience.

**Using Plot Reference Model**: If you want to design your custom model to fit your land parcel accurately, we offer a Plot Reference Model that you can download from the details page of your land on the dashboard. This model serves as a blueprint, clearly indicating the dimensions of your plot and entry points. Please note that these dimensions pertain to the plot layout only. Inside your realm, you have the creative freedom to build as extensively as you wish.

**Aligning the X Axis**: One crucial aspect to remember is that the X axis of your model should point outward from the door in Blender. This alignment ensures that your model integrates seamlessly with your parcel's layout and entry points.

**Elevate Your Realm with Custom Creations**

Custom 3D Models offer an avenue for you to imprint your artistic flair on Vaikunth's canvas. By following these guidelines, you can enrich your land parcel and share your creations with fellow explorers and collaborators.
