# Uploading Build

Once you've successfully built your project package, the next pivotal step is uploading it to the Infinity Void dashboard for deployment. Here's how to proceed:

**1. Package Zipping and Structure**

Before proceeding, ensure that your build files are properly zipped. The key is to maintain a specific structureâ€”your build files must be enclosed in a zipped folder. Typically, the build files are found within a folder named "windows." Feel free to rename this folder for clarity, but strictly avoid introducing additional layers of hierarchy, as this could disrupt the linking process and impact your application's functionality.

**2. Uploading the Package**

To upload your packaged project:

* Visit the Infinity Void dashboard.
* Navigate to the appropriate tab.
* Click on "Upload Unreal Engine Package."
* Choose the zipped file containing your build.

**3. Pending Review and Approval**

Upon successful upload, the status will display as pending. Our diligent content moderation team will review your submission. If all components align as required, your package will be approved for deployment.
