Congratulations! You have successfully installed the Infinity Void SDK into your Unreal Engine project. You are now ready to leverage its features and create immersive experiences within the Infinity Void Metaverse.

Once the installation is complete, confirm the following project settings to ensure compatibility with the Infinity Void platform.



The Infinity Void SDK is fully compatible with Unreal Engine 5.2 and Unreal Engine 5.2.1. While the SDK has not been specifically tested with previous versions of Unreal Engine, there is no reason for it to be incompatible. The SDK's design and functionality are intended to work seamlessly across different Unreal Engine versions.

Please note that for the best experience and optimal performance, it is recommended to use the Infinity Void SDK with Unreal Engine 5.2 or higher. However, if you are using an older version of Unreal Engine, you should still be able to utilize the SDK without any significant issues.

We strive to ensure backward compatibility and provide a smooth integration experience for developers, regardless of the Unreal Engine version they are using. As always, we recommend keeping your Unreal Engine version up to date to take advantage of the latest features and improvements.

Feel free to reach out to our support team or refer to the documentation for any specific instructions or considerations related to using the Infinity Void SDK with older versions of Unreal Engine.
