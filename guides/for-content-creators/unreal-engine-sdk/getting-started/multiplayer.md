# Interactable Elements

Making Elements Interactable

#### Step 8: Making Elements Interactable

* If you want to make in-game objects interactable, use the "BP\_InteractableBase" actor. Create a child class from it, modify the static mesh within the actor, and add interaction logic to the event graph.
* To add interaction functionality to any other class, like a pawn, add the "IVInterface" to it and follow the same interaction logic.
