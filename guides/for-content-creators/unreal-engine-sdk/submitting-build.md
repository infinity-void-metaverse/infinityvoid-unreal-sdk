# Submitting Your Project

Once you've successfully completed your project, the next pivotal step is uploading it to the Infinity Void dashboard for deployment. Here's how to proceed:

**1.Zipping Your Project Files**

Before you proceed, please make sure that your project files are correctly compressed into a `zip` archive. Ensure that you have removed the `intermediate`, `binaries`, `saved`, and `DerivedDataCache` folders before creating the zip. This will ensure that your zip file contains only the essential data, minimizing its size.

**2. Uploading the File**

To upload your project:

* Visit the Infinity Void dashboard.
* Navigate to the appropriate tab.
* Click on "Upload Unreal Engine Package."
* Choose the zipped file containing your project files.

**3. Pending Review and Approval**

Upon successful upload, the status will display as pending. Our diligent content moderation team will review your submission. If all components align as required, your project will be approved for deployment.

Uploading your project files ensures that a dedicated server is automatically built for your experience.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The larger the project, the more time it will take to load for users.
