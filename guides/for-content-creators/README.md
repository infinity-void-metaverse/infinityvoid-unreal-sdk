# For Content Creators

Before you start creating your scene, it's important to understand some basic fundamentals. The mall units in our tool are of various sizes, which means that experiences have to be built according to their respective sizes. To make this process easier, we have clubbed the mall units into 16 categories from A to P, based on their area. This means that units in the same category will have the same area. For example, scenes developed for Unit Category A could be used for all the units present in the same category. You can check your unit category by visiting the details page of our virtual mall unit via the dashboard, or it can be checked from [Unit Categories](https://app.gitbook.com/o/CsdWp9dxgshENH0vKG9M/s/2Fqk3HHSrpyR5OwsPaJR/content-creation/unit-categories)

**Getting Started**

Now, let's get started on creating your scene!

Step 1: First, log in to the Metaverse Creator Tool (assuming you have already downloaded it). To login, you need to authenticate yourself via the dashboard. Click on the "Authenticate via Dashboard" button, and you'll be redirected to the dashboard where you can log in. Once you log in, you can close the dashboard and return back to the application.

Step 2: On the left-hand side of the interface, you will find the outliner which lists down all the assets used in the scene. On the right-hand side, you can access the content browser which showcases all the available 3D models. Once you have found the desired model, simply drag and drop it into your scene. The first step is to find the 3D model of your unit. You can do this by navigating to Content Browser > 3D Models > Structures > Shop. On the left side of the interface, in the details panel, you can select the unit category and ceiling designs according to your preference.

Step 3: Now you could start placing the assets from a large variety of models according to your preference.â€‹
