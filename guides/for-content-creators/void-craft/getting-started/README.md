# Getting Started

Before embarking on the journey of deploying your scene on Infinity Void, it's imperative to ensure that you've met the necessary prerequisites.

### Creating Account on Infinity Void Dashboard <a href="#install-inworld-to-the-project" id="install-inworld-to-the-project"></a>

Integrating your Unreal project into Infinity Void's interconnected virtual world requires an active Infinity Void account. If you haven't already created an account, it's essential to sign up: [**Infinity Void Account Signup**](https://dashboard.infinityvoid.io/). Your Infinity Void account serves as the portal to our platform's diverse array of features and functionalities. It empowers you to share your creative vision with a wider audience. Please ensure that the account used has access to the land parcel or has purchased/subscribed to a land parcel.
