# Basics

The Basics page is a great place to start if you're new to the Metaverse Creator Tool. This tool is a user-friendly editor that allows you to create highly-detailed scenes with drag-and-drop ease, without requiring any prior knowledge of 3D design. The tool comes pre-loaded with a wide range of assets, materials, and programmed modules, all seamlessly integrated with the drag-and-drop functionality.

## User Interface

The entire UI of the creator tool can be broadly classified under 5 heads

### **Toolbar**

The toolbar is a collection of essential tools required during scene creation. Hovering over each icon on the toolbar reveals its purpose. Here is a list of the functions of each tool present on the toolbar:

`New Scene`: This tool creates a new scene from scratch, similar to the "New File" option found in other editing software.

`Load Saved Scene`: This tool lets you open previously saved scenes.

`Save Scene`: This tool enables you to save your current scene, so you can come back to it later.

`Save Scene As`: This tool allows you to make a copy or variant of the current scene, which can be useful for creating backups or experimenting with different versions.

`Display UI`: This tool lets you hide or unhide the editor UI, giving you a full-screen view of your scene.

`Undo/Redo`: These tools allow you to undo or redo your actions, in case you make a mistake or want to go back to a previous step.

`Lights`: This tool allows you to add lights to your scene, which can dramatically change the look and feel of your environment.

`Select, Translate, Rotate, Scale, Pivot World or Local, Snap`: These are all tools for manipulating objects in your scene. You can select, move, rotate, scale, and snap objects to specific positions and angles.

`Character`: This tool allows you to add character to your scene. You need to drag and drop the option in order to get the character to the scene.

`Play/Stop`: These buttons allow you to play and stop your character, so you can preview your environment with your character

`Zoom Selection`: This tool allows you to zoom in on the selected object.&#x20;

`Zoom Region`: This tool allows you to zoom in on a specific region of your scene.&#x20;

`Isolate`: This option allows you to hide all objects except for the selected object. This is useful when you want to focus on a particular object.&#x20;

`Unhide All Actors`: This tool allows you to unhide all the hidden objects in the scene. Align Camera: This option helps you align the camera to the selected object or a group of objects.&#x20;

`FOV`: FOV stands for "field of view." This tool allows you to adjust the field of view of the camera, which determines how much of the scene is visible

### Outliner

This lists all of the assets that have been added to the scene, making it easy to organize and manipulate them.

### Details Panel

This allows you to edit the properties of selected assets, such as their position, rotation, and scale, as well as other properties.

### Content Browser

This lets you search for and select additional assets to add to your scene.

### Material Editor

This provides a comprehensive toolset for editing materials, allowing you to customize the appearance of your assets with ease.
