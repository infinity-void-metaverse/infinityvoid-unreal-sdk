# Adding Custom Models

Here are the step-by-step instructions for adding 2D NFT in the scene:

1. Navigate to `Smart Objects` > `3D` > `Asset Importer`
2. Drag it to your scene.
3. In the details panel, you will see fields where you can add the `HTTP URL` for the custom model.
4. You also have the option to make the custom model `interactable`.&#x20;
5. Input the necessary details and submit.
6. The 3D model will be displayed.

{% hint style="info" %}
Interactable means if a user goes near the model, he/she can interact with it to get more information about the product.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only `GLB` and `GLTF` files are supported. Also, the 3D models have to be uploaded online and only the URL of the model has to be submitted.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
