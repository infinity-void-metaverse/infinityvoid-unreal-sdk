# Adding Building

### Adding Building Model

1. Navigate to `3D Models` > `Structure` > `Buildings`
2. Browse through the available building designs.
3. Choose a design that suits your project.
4. You have three options for building types: (i) Ground Floor Structures (ii) Upper Floor Structures (iii) Complete Buildings

{% hint style="info" %}
If you prefer a modular approach, select both Ground Floor Structures and Upper Floor Structures separately for kitbashing. Alternatively, you can choose a Complete Building for your project.
{% endhint %}

### Adding Doors

1. Go to `3D Models` > `Structure` > `Doors`
2. By default, buildings do not include doors. To add doors to a specific building, consider the following: If you've added, for instance, "Building\_05" to your scene, there should be a corresponding door called "Door\_05" meant for that building.

{% hint style="info" %}
You have the creative freedom to explore and select different door designs based on your preferences.

To add an elevator to a multi-storied building, follow these straightforward steps:

1. Visit `Smart Objects` > `3D` > `Elevator`.
2. Drag and drop the elevator into your scene.
3. On the left-hand side, locate the detail panels.
4. Adjust the elevator settings as needed:
   * **Speed (m/s):** Enter the desired speed in meters per second. Only input numbers. The default speed is `3 m/s`.
   * **Height (m):** Specify the elevator's travel height in meters.
5. Once you've input the details, click "Submit" to apply the changes.
