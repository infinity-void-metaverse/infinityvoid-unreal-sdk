## Virtual Land Parcels

The finite, traversable, 3D virtual city within Infinity Void is called Vaikuntha City _(meaning: abode of the divine)_. Vaikuntha city is divided into sectors consisting of virtual land parcels identified by unique plot numbers. Users can purchase virtual land from Infinity Void [official website](https://mint.infinityvoid.io/)  or from secondary [NFT Marketplaces](broken-reference). The unique ownership of the virtual land will be transferred from the seller (Infinity Void or other users) to the buyer (user) via a process called minting (creation) of a non-fungible token stored on the Ethereum blockchain. In case the virtual land was owned before by another user it is already minted and it will not be created again but the unique non-fungible token will be transferred to the new owner. In both cases, the buyer of the virtual land will get full control over this land within the virtual world to build on and use or to monetize on it.&#x20;

Each virtual land parcel in Vaikuntha city is accessible for users via roads or teleport functionality. The 3D virtual city consist of all basic infrastructure like roads, landscapes, water bodies, etc.&#x20;

## Unique Name

Unique names are ENS subdomains minted on the Ethereum blockchain.&#x20;

ENS subdomains allow you to set a unique name for your user account avatar. You can mint your personal ENS subdomain (unique name) via https://mint.infinityvoid.io/ensmint/. Users that don't mint a unique name will get a name represented by their name with unique number for example: "name#0000" (similar to Discord). Users who mint a unique name will be given that name.  For example, if the users name is Daniel with ENS this will be "Daniel" while without it will be "Daniel#unique number".
